PATCHES
=======

xwm is considered a minimally viable window manager solution and,
therefore, is missing several features that many users would 
consider "essential". For additional features, I have provided
instructions below for patching, as well as a respository for 
sharing and hosting user created patches:
    http://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm-patches


EXAMPLES
========

Check your xwm installed version:
    xwm -v

Usimg startx to run xwm:
    echo "exec xwm" > ~/.xinitrc
    startx

Using xbg to set a solid background color:
    xbg red

Using imagemagick to set a wallpaper:
    display -window root background.png

Patching xwm (after copying the *.patch into the source dir.):
    patch -p0 < mypatch.patch

DISCLAIMER
==========

xwm ("XCB Window Manager") is an homage to the original "X Window
Manager", which is now defunct and unmaintained. Both projects
are unaffiliated and do not share any common source code.
