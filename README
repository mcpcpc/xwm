xwm - a tiny XCB floating window manager

FEATURES
========

*   Few features (just works)
*   Extensible & configurable
*   Focus follows mouse

BUILD REQUIREMENTS
==================

Other than libxcb, xwm also uses several default utilities which can be
patched, configured or expanded to meet the users preference.

    application launcher   dmenu - https://git.suckless.org/dmenu
    terminal emulator      st - https://git.suckless.org/st
    internet browser       surf - https://git.suckless.org/surf

COMMANDS
========

The following aliased commands have been implemented (although most of the
default behaviors can be customized via the config.h file):

    Win+Button1+[drag]     interactive window move
    Win+Button3+[drag]     interactive window resize
    Win+Space              run launcher menu (default: dmenu_run)
    Win+Enter              create new terminal window (default: st)
    Win+b                  create new browser window (default: surf)
    Win+q                  kill focused window
    Win+Shift+q            quit window manager

PATCHES
=======

xwm is considered a minimally viable window manager solution and,
therefore, is missing several features that many users would 
consider "essential". For additional features, I have provided
instructions below for patching, as well as a respository for 
sharing and hosting user created patches:
    http://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm-patches


EXAMPLES
========

Check your xwm installed version:
    xwm -v

Usimg startx to run xwm:
    echo "exec xwm" > ~/.xinitrc
    startx

Using xbg to set a solid background color:
    xbg red

Using imagemagick and a shell script to set a wallpaper:
    curl -L -o bud https://bit.ly/38aAmDt
    chmod +x bud
    sudo install bud /usr/bin/
    bud ~/wallpaper/directory/
    echo "bud ~/wallpaper/directory/ & exec xwm" > ~./xinitrc

Patching xwm (after copying the *.patch into the source dir.):
    patch -p0 < mypatch.patch
